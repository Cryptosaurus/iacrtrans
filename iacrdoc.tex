\section*{Introduction}

The \texttt{iacrtans} \LaTeX{} class will be used by the new
``\publname'' journal.  The class is based on standard \LaTeX{}
classes and packages (mainly the \texttt{article} class with
\texttt{amsmath}), and should be similar in use to the \texttt{llncs}
class used for Springer's proceedings.  The \LaTeX{} source of this
documentation is meant as an example to show basic usage of the class.

The class is still in development and feedback and comments are welcome.

\section{\textcolor{red!70!black}{FAQ}: Frequently Asked Questions}

\subsection{Converting \texttt{llncs} papers to \texttt{iacrtrans}}

If you have a paper typeset with the \texttt{llncs} class, conversion
should be relatively easy.  The following steps should be sufficient
in most cases (for the submission version):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Replace \verb+\documentclass{llncs}+ with\\ \verb+\documentclass[submission,spthm]{iacrtrans}+;
\item Replace \verb+\bibliographystyle{splncs03}+ with
  \verb+\bibliographystyle{alpha}+;
\item Add a \verb+\keywords{}+ command before the abstract, with
  keywords separated by \verb+\and+;
\item Remove commands that might override the class style, such as
  \verb+\pagestyle{...}+ or \verb+\thispagestyle{...}+,
  change of margins (\emph{e.g.}  with the \texttt{geometry} package),
  change of fonts, \ldots
\item See also \autoref{sec:biblio} for information about how to
  typeset the bibliography.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Compilation issues}

If your document doesn't compile with the \texttt{iacrtrans} class,
you can try adding the \texttt{[nohyperref]} option.  This will
disable some code in the class that is known to be fragile, in
particular the generation of metadata.  If this fixes your compilation
problems, please try to define a clean version of \texttt{author},
\texttt{title} and/or \texttt{keywords} as optional arguments to
these commands (in particular, remove \LaTeX{}  macros, and write
everything on a single line), and see if you document now compiles
without the \texttt{[nohyperref]} option.

\subsection{Helping the editor}

We would be very grateful, if you help us to prepare the final version for publishing.
In order to generate bibliographic information for your paper, we parse the author and title fields of your tex files.
As there are a lot of special cases that the script needs to take into account, there are special \texttt{hints} you can provide.
Currently, this template supports \texttt{author-} and \texttt{title-hints}.
An example how these hints are used, e.\,g., for this document is:
\begin{verbatim}
%%% script AUTHOR: Ga{\"{e}}tan Leurent, Friedrich Wiemer%%%
%%% script TITLE: {IACR} Transactions on Syemmetric Cryptology%%%
\documentclass[preprint]{iacrtrans}
\end{verbatim}
Note the extra \{\} which are needed to tell bibtex how to handle special characters or parts that should be set in uppercase (e.\,g., for cipher names).
When using this hint fields, you should not use any custom \LaTeX-macro defined in your paper.

\section{Main Commands}

\subsection{Title page}

The following commands are used to input informations for the title page.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash title}} to define the title.

A shorter running title can be given as optional argument.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash subtitle}} to give an optional
subtitle.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash author}} to define the author list.

Author names must be delimited by \verb+\and+ macros.  If there is one
different affiliation for each author, authors and affiliations will be
numbered automatically.  Otherwise, each author name must be followed by
\verb+\inst{...}+ with the corresponding affiliation(s).

A shorter list of authors for the running head can be given as
optional argument.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash institute}} to give author's affiliation(s).

If there are several affiliations, they must be separated by
\verb+\and+ macros, and will be numbered automatically.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash keywords}} to give a list of
keywords.

Individual keywords should be separated by the \verb+\and+ macro.

If there are fragile commands in the keywords, use the optional argument
to give a text-only version of the keywords; this will be used for the
PDF metadata.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash email}} should be used inside the
\verb+\institute+ argument to typeset author's email address(es).  An
optional argument can be given for the hyperlink, if different from the
displayed email.  For instance, you can group emails as follows:\\
\verb+\email[alice@foo.com,bob@bob.com]{{alice,bob}@foo.com}+

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash thanks}}
can be used inside the \verb+\title+,
\verb+\author+ or \verb+\institute+ argument to generate a footnote with additional
information, if needed.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash maketitle}} is used to actually
typeset the title.

\paragraph{The \texttt{abstract} environment} should be used to typeset the abstract.

Note that the keywords should be given before starting the abstract environment.


\subsection{Theorems}

The \texttt{iacrtrans} class uses the \AmS{} packages to typeset
math.  In particular, it loads the \texttt{amsthm} package, and
predefines the following environments:
\begin{center}
  \ttfamily
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}l@{\hspace{1cm}}l}
theorem     & definition & remark \\
proposition & example    & note   \\
problem     & exercise   & case   \\
lemma       & property   &        \\
conjecture  & question   &        \\
corollary   & solution   &        \\
claim       &            &        \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that the \texttt{proof} environment automatically adds a QED
symbol at the end of the proof (unless you give option
\texttt{[spthm]} to the \texttt{iacrtrans} class).  If the QED symbol
is typeset at a wrong position, you can force its position with
\verb+\qedhere+.

\section{Class options}
\label{sec:options}

\subsection{Publication type}

The class supports four publication types, selected with the
following class options:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{[final]}] for final papers (default mode)
\item[\texttt{[preprint]}] for preprints (without copyright info)
\item[\texttt{[submission]}] for submissions (anonymous, with line numbers)
\item[\texttt{[draft]}] is similar to preprint, but activates draft
  mode for the underlying \texttt{article} class (which shows overfull hboxes), and other packages
  (\emph{e.g.} \texttt{graphicx}, \texttt{hyperref}).
\end{description}

\subsection{Other Options}

\paragraph{\texttt{[spthm]}}
provides theorem environments that emulates
\texttt{llncs} class's \texttt{sptheorem}:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \texttt{\textbackslash spnewtheorem} wrapper is provided
  around \AmS{} \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem}.  Note that the
  styling options are ignored; you should use standard
  \texttt{amsthm} commands for fine control.
\item The \AmS{} \texttt{proof} environment will not automatically add a
  QED symbol at the end of the proof.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\texttt{[floatrow]}}
uses the \texttt{floatrow} package to customize floats rather than the
plain \texttt{float} package.  In particular, this allows to typeset
floats side by side as shown in this example:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[floatrow]{iacrtrans}
\usepackage[demo]{graphicx}
\begin{document}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{floatrow}
    \ffigbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{1.png}}
    {\caption{This is caption 1.}}
    \ffigbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{2.png}}
    {\caption{This is caption 2.}}
  \end{floatrow}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

The row will be divided equally according to the number of figures, but
you can ask each figure to take its natural space instead with
\verb+\ffigbox[\FBwidth]+.  For more advanced use, see the
\texttt{floatrow} documentation.


\paragraph{\texttt{[nohyperref]}}
disables the automatic loading of
\texttt{hyperref}.  Use this is if your document fails to compile with
\texttt{hyperref} for some reason.

The \texttt{iacrtrans} class automatically loads \texttt{hyperref}
after all other packages.  If you need some packages to be loaded
\emph{after} \texttt{hyperref}, you should load \texttt{hyperref}
explicitly at the correct position, but not use the \texttt{[nohyperref]} option.

% \paragraph{\texttt{[metada]}}
% activates the automatic creation of PDF metadata.  This is
% enabled automatically byin the \texttt{final} version, but it has been disabled by default
% with other because the required sting manipulations are not very robust, and can
% result in weird errors.  If you get errors with this option, you
% should try to define a clean version of \texttt{author},
% \texttt{title} and/or \texttt{keywords} as optionnal arguments to
% these commands.

\section{Typesetting the Bibliography}
\label{sec:biblio}

% Borrowed from btxdoc.tex
\def\BibTeX{{\rm B\kern-.05em{\sc i\kern-.025em b}\kern-.08em
    T\kern-.1667em\lower.7ex\hbox{E}\kern-.125emX}}

Having good bibliographic references is very important for the
visibility of the journal.  Since we don't have a commercial editor,
authors need to make sure themselves that references are standardized
and clean.  We strongly encourage authors to use \BibTeX{} for the
bibliograpy, using bibliographic data
from \url{http://www.dblp.org} or \url{https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/}.

We are still working on a good solution for the bibliography, and we
expect to have more specific instructions when producing the final
version of the papers, including a dedicated \BibTeX{} style.


\section{Further instructions}

\paragraph{\LaTeX{} distribution, and worklow.}  \LaTeX{}
distributions are available on a variaty of platforms.  In particular,
we recommand the \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live}
distribution, which is updated regularly, include a large number of
packages, and is available on many platforms.
\begin{description}
\item[Linux:] A LaTeX installation is included in most Linux
  distributions.  Alternatively,
  \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live} can be installed
  easily without root access.
\item[Windows:] There are also good \LaTeX{} distributions for Windows,
  such as \href{http://www.miktex.org/}{MikTeX} and
  \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live}.
\item[MacOSX:] On MacOSX, TeX Live is available inside
  \href{http://www.tug.org/mactex/}{MacTeX}.
\end{description}


We recommand the use of \texttt{pdflatex} because it generally
supports more features than \texttt{latex} and \texttt{dvips}
(\texttt{xelatex} and \texttt{lualatex} are also missing some advanced
features from \texttt{pdflatex}).

\paragraph{Internal references.}

We recommend the use of \verb+\autoref+ from \texttt{hyperref}
(automatically loaded by the class).  For instance,
\verb+\autoref{sec:options}+ links to \autoref{sec:options}.

\paragraph{Pictures.}

We recommend the use of the \texttt{tikz} package to render pictures.

In particular, a large variety of crypto pictures made with
\texttt{tikz} is available at \url{http://www.iacr.org/authors/tikz/}.

\paragraph{External pictures.}  The \texttt{graphicx} is loaded by the
class, and is recommended for external figures.

If possible, external figures should be in a vector format: you can
use PDF files when compiling with \texttt{pdflatex}, and EPS files
when compiling with \texttt{latex}, and \texttt{dvips}.  Note that the
\verb+\includegraphics+ command will automatically select a file with
the right extension, so if you write \verb+\includegraphics{figure}+
and have two files \texttt{figure.pdf} and \texttt{figure.eps}, it
should work with both workflow.

\paragraph{Floats.}

Figure captions should be below the figures, and table captions above
the tables.  The \texttt{float} package loaded by the class should
take care of this automatically.  If want to have several figures side
by side, see the \texttt{[floatrow]} option.

\paragraph{Tables.}

We recommend the \texttt{booktabs} package to typeset tables.

\paragraph{Algorithms.}

We recommend the \texttt{algorithm}, \texttt{algorithmcx} packages for
algorithms (in particular, \texttt{algpseudocode} for pseudo-code).


\section{For the Editor}

The following commands should be used by the editor to prepare the final
version:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setfirstpage} to set the first page number.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setlastpage} to set the first page number (optional).
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setvolume} to set the volume number.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setnumber} to set the edition number.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setDOI} to set the DOI\@.
\end{itemize}

There is a special \texttt{settings.tosc.tex} file, that sets default values for these commands
and which can be included in the beginning of the main tex file.

\item Documentation of the \LaTeX{} packages used in the class (see below).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Packages used}

The class is based on the standard \texttt{article} class, and loads
the following packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{geometry}, \texttt{secsty}, \texttt{fancyhdr}, \texttt{mathtools},
  \texttt{float}, \texttt{microtype}, \texttt{lastpage}
\item \texttt{amsmath}, \texttt{amssymb}, \texttt{amsthm}
\item \texttt{graphicx}
